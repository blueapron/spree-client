When the duo noticed that modern skillets couldn’t live up to the quality of the vintage ones they grew up using, they were determined to design a contemporary take on an old-school staple. Their resulting Field Skillet is machined and polished, which reduces the weight, increases the fineness of the form and provides a smooth cooking surface. Each eco-friendly pan is made in the USA from 75-90% recycled cast iron, which has a pre-seasoned surface that'll improve over time to form a natural, non-stick surface. It's ideal for cooking a wide-range of dishes, from roasted vegetables to perfectly seared steaks. Due to its incredible versatility, you can braise it over coals, simmer it on the latest induction cooktop, serve it on your table and even hang it on your wall. For an even easier cleaning experience, use our <a href=\"https://www.blueapron.com/market/products/cast-iron-scrubber\">Cast Iron Scrubber</a>. ",

Smokey and sweet all at once, Jacobsen Salt’s Smoked Honey Sauce will become your new go-to condiment for all kinds of BBQ (think pulled pork shoulder, ribs and brisket), cheeses, roasted veggies, tacos, fried chicken and more! Using single-origin, sustainably produced, premium Bee Local honey, Jacobsen Salt’s Smoked Honey Sauce stands out from the rest through their commitment to quality. After cold-smoking the honey, it’s infused with Lapsang Souchong (smoked tea) and given a dash of apple cider vinegar for balance. Take our word for it: the result is one of the most distinctive and addictive products Jacobsen Salt has created to date.
