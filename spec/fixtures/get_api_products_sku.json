  "description": "Yes, there is such a thing as the perfect pan: nonstick, never scratches, oven-safe to 500 degrees and lasts forever. \n<br> <br> \nWhether you’re cooking something that requires a delicate touch—think over-easy eggs, seared salmon and paper-thin crepes—or searing big, juicy steaks over high heat, Scanpan defies every conventional assumption made about traditional nonstick cookware. Its smooth, toxic-free cooking surface makes cooking and cleaning a breeze, and it browns, braises, and deglazes like professional cookware—but all on a coated surface so strong, it stands up even to harsh metal utensils. The Scanpan is probably the last pan you’ll ever buy.",
